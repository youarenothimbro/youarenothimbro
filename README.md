# 👋 Hey there

{
  about me
  [
     - I am the creator and developer of **11Scripts** – a collection of **high-performance** scripts for FiveM and more.
      - All my repositories are intentionally compact, partially protected (through obfuscation), and designed for advanced users who value reliability and discretion.
       - I specialize in building optimized solutions with a focus on **performance**, **functionality**, and **privacy**.
